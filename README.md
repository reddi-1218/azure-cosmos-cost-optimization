# 💰 Azure Cosmos DB Cost Optimization Strategies

This document outlines practical strategies to reduce costs in your serverless Cosmos DB + Azure Blob Storage architecture, particularly for read-heavy billing systems.

---

## 🧊 1. Data Tiering (Cold Archival)
Move infrequently accessed data (older than 3 months) from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage (Cool or Archive tier).

✅ **Benefit**: Cosmos DB storage is expensive per GB; Blob Storage is far cheaper.  
✅ **Use**: Timer-triggered Function to archive old data weekly or monthly.  
📉 **Cost Impact**: Reduces Cosmos DB storage by ~70–90%

---

## ⚙️ 2. Use Serverless (Consumption-Based) Cosmos DB
Ensure your Cosmos DB is set to **Serverless mode** if traffic is bursty or low-volume.

✅ Ideal for workloads where usage is spiky or <1000 RU/s baseline.  
❗ Avoid if you have sustained high traffic—use autoscale instead.

---

## 🧾 3. Use Compressed or Batched Records
Batch records into 1 document per day/week or compress large fields.

✅ Example: Store all billing records of a customer per month in one document.  
✅ Use `gzip` or `base64` for long JSON blobs.  
📉 Can reduce storage by 30–50%

---

## 🔍 4. Indexing Policy Optimization
Disable indexing on archived fields or large unqueried blobs.

✅ Example:  
```json
{ "indexingMode": "consistent", "includedPaths": [...], "excludedPaths": ["/data/*"] }
```

📉 Saves RU/s and storage costs

---

## 🔁 5. Time-to-Live (TTL) for Temporary Data
Enable TTL to automatically delete records (e.g., logs or temp data).

✅ Simple to configure per record or container

---

## 🚀 6. Use Change Feed for Background Processing
Use Cosmos DB Change Feed with Azure Functions to move aging records to Blob.

✅ Real-time, efficient, and serverless

---

## 🧠 7. Partition Key Design Review
Choose even-distribution keys like `customerId` or `billingMonth`.

✅ Prevents hot partitions  
❗ Avoid common keys for all users

---

## 🌐 8. Use Azure Defender / Cost Insights
Monitor with:
- Azure Advisor
- Cosmos Insights
- Cost Management + Alerts

✅ Helps find high RU queries, unused indexes, and skewed usage

---

## 🔒 9. Avoid Unbounded Queries
❌ Avoid `SELECT *`  
✅ Use `SELECT id`, `TOP`, `OFFSET`, `LIMIT`

---

## 🔄 10. Blob Storage Lifecycle Management
Auto-tier blobs using lifecycle rules:

- After 30 days → Cool tier  
- After 90 days → Archive tier  

✅ Long-term storage savings
